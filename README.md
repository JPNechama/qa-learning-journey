## 💡 Why This Is Unique
Coming from **Industrial Design**, I bring:  
- **Attention to detail** → spotting small issues, whether in a product or in code.  
- **Creative problem-solving** → finding innovative ways to test and improve usability.  
- **User focus** → ensuring both physical and digital products meet real-world needs.  

These skills, combined with my QA training, allow me to see software testing with a broader perspective.
